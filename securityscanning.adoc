= Terraform Security Scanning with Checkov (Windows OS)
John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
v1.0, 2024-12-31

This lab demonstrates how to install and use the Checkov security scanner on Windows to detect misconfigurations in Terraform code. Checkov is an open-source tool that scans infrastructure-as-code (IaC) files for potential security and compliance issues. You will create a simple Terraform configuration, introduce a few insecure settings, and use Checkov to identify them.

== In This Lab, You Will

- **Install required tools** (Terraform, Python, and Checkov) on Windows.
- **Create a sample Terraform configuration** that has deliberate security misconfigurations.
- **Run Checkov** locally to detect the issues.
- **Review the security scan results** and see how to remediate them.

== Prerequisites

1. **Windows Operating System** (Windows 10 or later).
2. **Administrator permissions** on your machine (to install software).

----

== Section 1: Tool Installation

=== 1.1 Install Terraform (Windows)

1. Go to the official Terraform download page:  
   https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads
2. Download the appropriate **Windows 64-bit** version (or 32-bit if your system requires it).
3. Unzip the downloaded archive (e.g., `terraform_1.x.x_windows_amd64.zip`) into a folder, such as `C:\Terraform\`.
4. Add this folder to your **PATH** environment variable:
   - Press `Win + X`, select **System** (or **Settings** -> **System**).
   - Click **Advanced system settings**, then **Environment Variables**.
   - Under **System Variables**, find **Path**, edit, and add `C:\Terraform`.
5. Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell and verify installation:
   ----
   terraform -version
   ----
   You should see the installed Terraform version.

=== 1.2 Install Python (if not already installed)

1. Download and install Python for Windows from:  
   https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
2. During installation, ensure **"Add Python 3.x to PATH"** is selected.
3. After installation, verify in a new Command Prompt or PowerShell:
   ----
   python --version
   ----

=== 1.3 Install Checkov

Checkov can be installed via **pip** (the Python package manager).

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Run:
   ----
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install checkov
   ----
3. Verify installation:
   ----
   checkov --version
   ----
   You should see the installed Checkov version.

----

== Section 2: Create a Simple Terraform Configuration

=== 2.1 Directory Setup

Create a folder for your project, e.g. `C:\Projects\tfsec-lab\` (the name can differ, `checkov-lab` is also fine). Inside it, create the following files:

----
tfsec-lab/
├── main.tf
└── variables.tf
----

=== 2.2 `main.tf`
[source,hcl]
----
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

# Intentionally insecure S3 bucket: no encryption, no versioning
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "insecure_example" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
  acl    = "public-read"  # Insecure, allows public read

  # Missing server-side encryption
  # Missing versioning block
}
----

=== 2.3 `variables.tf`
[source,hcl]
----
variable "aws_region" {
  type    = string
  default = "us-east-1"
}

variable "bucket_name" {
  type    = string
  default = "my-weak-security-bucket-123"
}
----

*Why Is This Insecure?*
- **Public Read ACL**: Exposes data to the internet without restriction.
- **Missing Encryption**: Data at rest is not protected by server-side encryption.
- **Missing Versioning**: No version control for auditing or accidental deletion protection.

----

== Section 3: Running Terraform (Optional)

If you want to test Terraform locally:
1. **Initialize**:
   ----
   terraform init
   ----
2. **Plan** (to see what would be created):
   ----
   terraform plan
   ----
3. **(Optional) Apply** (creates actual resources in AWS):
   ----
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ----
   
*Important*: If you do this, ensure you have **AWS credentials** set up (e.g., via environment variables or `aws configure`). This step is optional because the main focus is on scanning for vulnerabilities with Checkov.

----

== Section 4: Scanning Terraform with Checkov

Now, let’s run Checkov to identify security and compliance issues in our Terraform configuration.

=== 4.1 Basic Checkov Command

1. Navigate to the `C:\Projects\tfsec-lab\` directory (or wherever you placed the `.tf` files).
2. Run:
   ----
   checkov -d .
   ----
   This tells Checkov to scan the current directory (`.`) for Terraform files.

=== 4.2 Interpreting the Results

Checkov will output a summary of passed checks and failed checks. Look for sections like:
- **FAILED** checks describing missing encryption, public ACL on S3, no versioning, etc.
- **PASSED** checks for configurations that meet best practices.

Expect to see output similar to:
----
Check: CKV_AWS_52: "Ensure S3 bucket has versioning enabled"
        FAILED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.insecure_example
Check: CKV_AWS_21: "Ensure S3 bucket is private"
        FAILED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.insecure_example
Check: CKV_AWS_19: "Ensure S3 bucket has server-side encryption enabled"
        FAILED for resource: aws_s3_bucket.insecure_example
...
Result: Failed checks: 3, Passed checks: ...
----

You may see a code snippet referencing the lines in `main.tf` that trigger each failure.

=== 4.3 Recommended Remediation

For each failed check, Checkov provides a link or an explanation with recommended changes, such as:
- Enabling `versioning { enabled = true }`.
- Setting `acl = "private"` or removing it entirely.
- Adding server-side encryption via `server_side_encryption_configuration`.

Example fix for S3 encryption:
[source,hcl]
----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "secure_example" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
  acl    = "private"

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }

  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        sse_algorithm = "aws:kms"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

----

== Section 5: Cleanup (Optional)

If you created any AWS resources using `terraform apply`, you should remove them:
----
terraform destroy -auto-approve
----

Confirm that the S3 bucket is deleted from your AWS account. This helps avoid unnecessary charges or resource usage.

----

== Section 6: (Bonus) Automating Scans in a CI Pipeline

You can integrate Checkov into a GitHub Actions or other CI workflow. Below is a simple snippet for GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/checkov.yaml`):

[source,yaml]
----
name: "Checkov Security Scan"

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  checkov:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: "3.x"

      - name: Install Checkov
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install checkov

      - name: Run Checkov
        run: checkov -d .
----

*Key Points*
- This workflow scans your Terraform files on each push or pull request to `main`.
- If any critical checks fail, the pipeline will show errors, prompting immediate remediation.

----

== Recap and Best Practices

- **Automate Security**: Tools like Checkov or tfsec ensure security best practices are not overlooked.
- **Shift Left**: Integrate scanning early (local dev and CI pipelines) to catch misconfigurations before they reach production.
- **Remediate Findings**: Use the detailed check failure messages to fix issues (e.g., enabling encryption, restricting ACLs).
- **Version Control**: Keep your `.tf` files in a repository for collaboration and auditing.

----

== Conclusion

By completing this lab, you have:
- Installed Terraform, Python, and Checkov on Windows.
- Created an intentionally insecure Terraform configuration.
- Scanned the configuration with Checkov to identify vulnerabilities.
- Learned how to interpret and remediate security findings.
- Explored how to integrate Checkov scanning into a CI workflow for continuous security validation.

You are now better prepared to maintain secure infrastructure-as-code, reduce risks, and ensure compliance in your Terraform projects.
