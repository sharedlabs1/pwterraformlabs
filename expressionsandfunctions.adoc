= Lab: Using Terraform Expressions and Functions in a Local Configuration

== Objective

This lab focuses on Terraform expressions and functions, enabling you to:

1. Use string and arithmetic expressions.
2. Leverage built-in Terraform functions (e.g., `join`, `split`, `merge`, `cidrhost`, and `timestamp`).
3. Dynamically configure resources using Terraform.

== Scenario

You are tasked with creating a configuration file that contains:

1. A dynamically generated project name based on variables.
2. A split list of IP addresses extracted from a CIDR range.
3. A timestamp of when the configuration was applied.
4. Merged metadata for a project.

== Prerequisites

1. Terraform installed locally.
2. A basic understanding of Terraform syntax.

== Steps

=== Step 1: Set Up the Project Directory

1. Create a directory for the lab:
[source,bash]
----
mkdir terraform_lab_expressions
cd terraform_lab_expressions
----

2. Create the following files:
   * `main.tf`
   * `variables.tf`
   * `output.tf`

=== Step 2: Define Variables

Open `variables.tf` and define variables for the project name and network CIDR block.

[source,hcl]
----
variable "project_name" {
  description = "Base name of the project"
  default     = "TerraformLab"
}

variable "cidr_block" {
  description = "CIDR block for the network"
  default     = "192.168.0.0/24"
}

variable "metadata" {
  description = "Project metadata tags"
  type        = map(string)
  default     = {
    environment = "development"
    owner       = "team"
  }
}
----

=== Step 3: Configure Outputs with Expressions and Functions

Open `main.tf` and use expressions and functions to dynamically generate outputs.

[source,hcl]
----
# Dynamic Project Name
output "dynamic_project_name" {
  description = "The dynamically generated project name"
  value       = join("-", [var.project_name, "v1"])
}

# Base IP Address
output "base_ip" {
  description = "The base IP address of the CIDR block"
  value       = split("/", var.cidr_block)[0]
}

# Tenth Host IP Address
output "host_ip" {
  description = "The 10th host IP address in the CIDR block"
  value       = cidrhost(var.cidr_block, 10)
}

# Current Timestamp
output "configuration_time" {
  description = "The time when the configuration was applied"
  value       = timestamp()
}

# Merged Metadata
output "merged_metadata" {
  description = "Combined metadata for the project"
  value       = merge(var.metadata, { project_name = var.project_name })
}
----

=== Step 4: Initialize and Apply

1. Initialize Terraform:
[source,bash]
----
terraform init
----

2. Apply the configuration:
[source,bash]
----
terraform apply
----

3. Confirm the apply process by typing `yes`.

== Expected Outputs

=== Dynamic Project Name
[source,plaintext]
----
dynamic_project_name = "TerraformLab-v1"
----

=== Base IP Address
[source,plaintext]
----
base_ip = "192.168.0.0"
----

=== Tenth Host IP Address
[source,plaintext]
----
host_ip = "192.168.0.10"
----

=== Configuration Time
[source,plaintext]
----
configuration_time = "2024-12-28T12:00:00Z"
----

=== Merged Metadata
[source,plaintext]
----
merged_metadata = {
  "environment" = "development"
  "owner" = "team"
  "project_name" = "TerraformLab"
}
----

== Summary

In this lab, you:

1. Used expressions (`join`, `split`, `cidrhost`) to dynamically generate values.
2. Leveraged the `timestamp` function for logging.
3. Dynamically merged metadata tags with project details using `merge`.

This lab demonstrates how Terraform functions and expressions make configurations more adaptable and efficient without relying on cloud-specific resources.
