:doctype: book

== Objective
In this lab, you will explore advanced provisioning techniques in Terraform using the **Null Resource** and **Provisioners**. You will:
- Implement complex provisioning workflows using the **Null resource**.
- Learn how to implement **self-healing infrastructure patterns** using Terraform provisioners.
- Understand the difference between **creation-time vs destroy-time provisioners**.
- Handle complex failure modes and implement recovery strategies.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to create self-healing infrastructure with advanced provisioning logic and properly handle failures during provisioning and destruction.

== Scenario
You are tasked with provisioning an **EC2 instance** and configuring it with some services using a combination of **Null Resource**, **local-exec**, and **remote-exec** provisioners. The scenario includes:
1. Using the **Null Resource** to handle a complex provisioning workflow.
2. Implementing a **self-healing infrastructure pattern** where if the provisioning fails, the system can automatically recover.
3. Creating a **destroy-time provisioner** that runs during resource destruction to clean up resources.
4. Handling failure scenarios and implementing recovery strategies using retry logic.

== Lab Steps

=== 1. Set Up AWS Credentials
Ensure that you have configured AWS credentials to allow Terraform to create resources.

Example:
[source,bash]
----
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
----

Ensure that you have **AWS CLI** installed and configured with the same credentials.

[source,bash]
----
aws configure
----

=== 2. Create Terraform Configuration
1. **Create a new directory** for your Terraform configuration files.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir terraform-advanced-provisioning
cd terraform-advanced-provisioning
----

2. **Create a `main.tf` file** to define your AWS EC2 instance, Null Resource, and various provisioners for complex workflows.

[source,hcl]
----
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Ubuntu 20.04 LTS AMI ID for your region
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  # Security Group to allow SSH
  security_groups = ["allow_ssh"]

  # User data to install AWS CLI and dependencies
  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              apt-get update
              apt-get install -y awscli
              EOF

  # Connection details for SSH
  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }

  # Provisioner to handle complex setup with Null Resource
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "echo 'Initializing complex provisioning workflow on EC2 instance.'",
      "mkdir -p /tmp/service_config",
      "aws s3 cp s3://my-config-bucket/service_config.json /tmp/service_config/"
    ]
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ssh" {
  name        = "allow_ssh"
  description = "Allow SSH access"
  
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Null resource to handle complex workflows and self-healing patterns
resource "null_resource" "complex_provisioning" {
  depends_on = [aws_instance.example]

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo 'Running complex provisioning logic for EC2 instance creation and configuration.'"
  }

  # Create a destroy-time provisioner for cleanup
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    when    = destroy
    command = "aws s3 rm s3://my-config-bucket/service_config.json"
  }

  triggers = {
    always_run = "${timestamp()}"
  }
}
----

In this configuration:
- An **EC2 instance** is provisioned with user data to install AWS CLI.
- **Remote-exec** provisioner is used to copy a configuration file (`service_config.json`) from an S3 bucket to the EC2 instance.
- The **Null Resource** (`null_resource`) is used for implementing complex workflows such as provisioning logic and self-healing patterns.
- **Destroy-time provisioners** are used to clean up the S3 bucket (`service_config.json`) when the resource is destroyed.
- **Triggers** are used in the Null Resource to ensure the provisioning logic always runs when the configuration is applied, even if no other changes are made.

3. **Create `service_config.json` in your S3 bucket** (make sure to upload a test file to your S3 bucket).

[source,bash]
----
aws s3 cp service_config.json s3://my-config-bucket/
----

=== 3. Initialize Terraform
Run `terraform init` to initialize your working directory. This command will download the necessary provider plugins.

[source,bash]
----
terraform init
----

=== 4. Plan the Infrastructure Changes
Run `terraform plan` to see the changes Terraform will make. This command will show you a preview of the EC2 instance creation and complex provisioning workflows.

[source,bash]
----
terraform plan
----

Verify that Terraform plans to:
- Create an AWS EC2 instance.
- Set up the security group allowing SSH.
- Run the `remote-exec` provisioner to copy a configuration file from S3 to the instance.
- Implement the complex provisioning logic using the `null_resource`.

=== 5. Apply the Terraform Configuration
Run `terraform apply` to apply the configuration and create the resources.

[source,bash]
----
terraform apply
----

Terraform will:
1. Create the EC2 instance and security group.
2. Execute the `remote-exec` provisioner to copy the `service_config.json` file from S3 to the instance.
3. Use the `null_resource` to run complex provisioning logic and execute the destroy-time cleanup.

Confirm the apply by typing `yes` when prompted.

=== 6. Handle Failure and Self-Healing
To test **self-healing** infrastructure, simulate a failure scenario by manually stopping the EC2 instance.

1. SSH into the EC2 instance and simulate failure (e.g., stop a critical service).

2. The **self-healing pattern** in Terraform can automatically recover resources using **retries** or by invoking additional provisioning steps within the **Null Resource** to recover or restart services.

3. Use **retry logic** in the `local-exec` or `remote-exec` provisioners to ensure that failed commands are retried until they succeed.

Example:
[source,hcl]
----
resource "null_resource" "self_healing" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "bash /scripts/restart_service.sh"
    retries = 5
    retry_delay = "10s"
  }
}
----

=== 7. Verify Destroy-Time Provisioner
Once the resources are created, run `terraform destroy` to trigger the **destroy-time provisioner** and verify that resources such as the S3 object are cleaned up properly.

[source,bash]
----
terraform destroy
----

Terraform will:
- Trigger the `destroy-time` provisioner to remove the configuration file (`service_config.json`) from S3.
- Ensure that the infrastructure is cleaned up, preventing orphaned resources.

=== 8. Handling Failure Modes and Recovery Strategies
In cases where provisioning fails (e.g., the EC2 instance doesn't start, or the provisioning script fails), Terraform will return an error message, and you can implement the following strategies:
- **Retry logic** in provisioners to attempt commands again after failure.
- **Conditional logic** in the `local-exec` or `remote-exec` provisioners to only run tasks when specific conditions are met.
- **Self-healing logic** in the `null_resource` provisioners to trigger recovery scripts, restarting services or recreating resources.

== Summary of the Lab
In this lab, you learned how to use **advanced provisioning techniques** in Terraform with the **Null Resource** and **Provisioners**. Here's a summary of what you accomplished:
- **Implemented complex provisioning workflows** using the **Null Resource**.
- Learned how to implement **self-healing infrastructure patterns** by automating recovery processes.
- Explored the difference between **creation-time vs destroy-time provisioners** and their use cases.
- Handled **failure modes** and implemented **recovery strategies** to ensure resilient infrastructure.

== Key Takeaways:
- The **Null Resource** is a powerful tool for orchestrating complex workflows and ensuring self-healing infrastructure.
- **Provisioners** like `local-exec` and `remote-exec` can be combined to automate post-provisioning tasks and recovery actions.
- Handling **failure modes** early and implementing **retries** and **self-healing logic** ensures that your infrastructure is resilient and can automatically recover from issues.
