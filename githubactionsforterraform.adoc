= GitHub Actions Pipeline for Simple Terraform Deployment
John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
v1.0, 2024-12-31

This lab demonstrates how to set up a basic GitHub Actions pipeline that automatically runs Terraform to deploy a simple infrastructure stack (e.g., an AWS S3 bucket). Once you push this configuration to your GitHub repository, the pipeline will plan and (optionally) apply the Terraform changes.

== In This Lab, You Will

- **Create a simple Terraform configuration** to provision an AWS S3 bucket.
- **Define variables** to store key parameters like bucket names and region.
- **Set up a GitHub Actions workflow** that:
  - Checks out your repository code.
  - Installs and configures Terraform.
  - Configures AWS credentials securely.
  - Validates and plans your Terraform configuration.
  - (Optionally) applies the Terraform plan on pushes to the `main` branch.
- **Configure GitHub repository secrets** to store AWS credentials securely.
- **Observe the CI/CD pipeline** in your GitHub repository and verify the created infrastructure in AWS.

== Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository**  
   - You must have a GitHub repository where you can commit and push your configuration files.
2. **Terraform Installed (Optional for local testing)**  
   - You can test locally, but for this exercise, GitHub Actions will perform the Terraform tasks in its runner environment.
3. **AWS Credentials**  
   - Store `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` as GitHub repository secrets (under "Settings" -> "Secrets and variables" -> "Actions" in your repo).
   - This ensures sensitive information is not exposed in the repository.
4. **IAM Permissions**  
   - The AWS user whose credentials you use must have the permissions to create and manage S3 buckets (e.g., `s3:CreateBucket`, `s3:DeleteBucket`).

== Directory Structure

Create (or confirm) the following structure in your repository:
----
my-terraform-repo/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── terraform.yaml
└── README.md
----

- **`main.tf`**: Contains your primary Terraform configuration.
- **`variables.tf`**: Declares variables and defaults for your Terraform setup.
- **`.github/workflows/terraform.yaml`**: Defines the GitHub Actions pipeline.
- **`README.md`**: Optional documentation for your project.

== Step 1: Create a Simple Terraform Configuration

Create a file named `main.tf` in the root of your repository:
[source,hcl]
----
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
  acl    = "private"

  tags = {
    Name        = var.bucket_name
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}
----

*Key Points*
- This resource block creates an S3 bucket using the name specified by `var.bucket_name`.
- The bucket is tagged to reflect the environment and name.

== Step 2: Define Variables

Create a file named `variables.tf` in the root of your repository:
[source,hcl]
----
variable "aws_region" {
  type        = string
  description = "AWS region to create resources in"
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

variable "bucket_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "Name of the S3 bucket. Must be globally unique."
  default     = "my-unique-bucket-123456"
}

variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment name (e.g., dev, prod)"
  default     = "dev"
}
----

*Tips*
- Update `bucket_name` to something globally unique (e.g., include random characters).
- Keep your `environment` variable to easily track dev, staging, or production setups.

== Step 3: Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a file named `.github/workflows/terraform.yaml`:
[source,yaml]
----
name: "Terraform CI"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  terraform:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.5.4

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v2
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}

      - name: Initialize Terraform
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Format
        run: terraform fmt -check

      - name: Terraform Validate
        run: terraform validate

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan -out=plan.out

      # Uncomment the next step if you want to automatically deploy changes to AWS on pushes to main
      - name: Terraform Apply
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve plan.out
----

*Key Steps Explained*
- **Check out repository**: Gets your code from GitHub into the runner.
- **Set up Terraform**: Installs the specified version of Terraform.
- **Configure AWS Credentials**: Pulls AWS credentials stored in GitHub Secrets.
- **Initialize Terraform**: Downloads and configures necessary Terraform providers/modules.
- **Terraform Format & Validate**: Ensures your `.tf` files follow best practices and are syntactically correct.
- **Terraform Plan**: Generates and saves an execution plan as `plan.out`.
- **Terraform Apply**: Executes the plan if you push to the `main` branch (optional and can be commented out if you only want to review plans).

== Step 4: Configure GitHub Secrets

. Go to **Settings** -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions** in your GitHub repository.  
. Create three new repository secrets:
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `AWS_REGION`
. Make sure these credentials allow creating/deleting AWS S3 buckets.

== Step 5: Commit and Push

1. Add, commit, and push your files (`main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `.github/workflows/terraform.yaml`) to `main`.
2. For example:
----
git add .
git commit -m "Add basic Terraform config and GitHub Actions workflow"
git push origin main
----

== Step 6: Observe the Pipeline

1. In your GitHub repository, click on **Actions** in the top menu.
2. Select the "Terraform CI" workflow run triggered by your push to `main`.
3. Watch the logs for:
   - **Terraform init** and provider installation
   - **Terraform format** and validation checks
   - **Terraform plan** to display infrastructure changes
   - **Terraform apply** (if enabled) to provision changes in AWS

== Step 7: Verify Your Infrastructure

1. Log into the AWS console and navigate to **S3**.
2. Look for a bucket named according to `var.bucket_name` (e.g., `my-unique-bucket-123456`).
3. Click on the bucket to see its tags, which should match:
   - `Name = my-unique-bucket-123456`
   - `Environment = dev`

== Step 8: Cleanup (Optional)

If you want to remove the created AWS resources:
- Locally, you can run:
----
terraform destroy -auto-approve
----
- Or add a "destroy" step in your GitHub Actions workflow (not recommended for production, but can be useful for ephemeral testing).  
- Verify in AWS that the bucket is removed.

== Recap and Best Practices

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Keep your Terraform files in version control for easy collaboration and review.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions automatically tests and applies your code, reducing manual effort and mistakes.
- **Secure Secrets**: Do not store AWS credentials in plain text; always use GitHub Secrets or a secure vault.
- **Planning vs. Applying**: Decide whether you want to automatically apply to AWS or just review plans. This depends on your team's deployment strategy.
- **Scalability**: Expand this workflow to include more complex resources, multi-environment setups, or approvals for production changes.

== Conclusion

By completing this lab, you have:
- Created a simple Terraform configuration that provisions an S3 bucket.
- Configured a GitHub Actions pipeline to **plan** and (optionally) **apply** these Terraform changes.
- Stored AWS credentials securely in GitHub Secrets.
- Verified deployment in the AWS console.

You now have a foundational CI/CD pipeline for Terraform, which you can extend to manage larger, multi-environment infrastructures with greater automation and reliability.
