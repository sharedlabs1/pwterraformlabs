== Objective
In this lab, you will learn how to use the **File Provisioner** in Terraform to upload files from the local machine to a remote resource (e.g., an EC2 instance). By the end of this lab, you will understand how to configure and use the `file` provisioner to automate file transfers as part of resource provisioning.

== Scenario
You are tasked with provisioning an **EC2 instance** in AWS using Terraform. After the EC2 instance is created, you need to upload a configuration file (`config_file.conf`) to the instance to configure a service. The EC2 instance is running **Ubuntu**, and you will use SSH to upload the file.

== Lab Steps

=== 1. Set Up AWS Credentials
Ensure that you have configured AWS credentials (either using environment variables or AWS credentials file) to allow Terraform to create resources.

Example:
[source,bash]
----
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
----

=== 2. Create Terraform Configuration
1. **Create a new directory** for your Terraform configuration files.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir terraform-file-provisioner
cd terraform-file-provisioner
----

2. **Create a `main.tf` file** that will define your AWS EC2 instance and the file provisioner.

[source,hcl]
----
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Ubuntu 20.04 LTS AMI ID for your region
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  # Security Group to allow SSH
  security_groups = ["allow_ssh"]

  # User data to install SSH
  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              apt-get update
              apt-get install -y openssh-server
              EOF

  # Define File Provisioner
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "./config_file.conf"     # File on local machine
    destination = "/tmp/config_file.conf"  # Destination on EC2 instance
  }

  # Connection details for SSH
  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ssh" {
  name        = "allow_ssh"
  description = "Allow SSH access"
  
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
----

In this configuration:
- We define an AWS EC2 instance (`aws_instance`) with a simple Ubuntu AMI.
- We use a **File Provisioner** to copy a local file (`config_file.conf`) to the instance's `/tmp/` directory.
- A **Security Group** is created to allow SSH access to the EC2 instance.
- SSH connection details are provided in the `connection` block to allow Terraform to interact with the instance.

3. **Create the `config_file.conf`** in the same directory:

[source,bash]
----
echo "app_config = { max_connections = 100 }" > config_file.conf
----

=== 3. Initialize Terraform
Run `terraform init` to initialize your working directory. This command downloads the necessary provider plugins.

[source,bash]
----
terraform init
----

=== 4. Plan the Infrastructure Changes
Run `terraform plan` to see the changes Terraform will make. This command will show you a preview of the EC2 instance creation and file provisioning process.

[source,bash]
----
terraform plan
----

Verify that Terraform plans to:
- Create an AWS EC2 instance.
- Create a security group allowing SSH.
- Upload the `config_file.conf` to the EC2 instance.

=== 5. Apply the Terraform Configuration
Run `terraform apply` to apply the configuration and create the resources.

[source,bash]
----
terraform apply
----

Terraform will:
1. Create the EC2 instance.
2. Create the security group.
3. Upload the `config_file.conf` file to `/tmp/` on the EC2 instance.

Confirm the apply by typing `yes` when prompted.

=== 6. Verify the File Upload
Once the Terraform apply is complete, SSH into the EC2 instance to verify that the file was successfully uploaded.

1. Get the public IP of the EC2 instance:

[source,bash]
----
terraform output aws_instance_example_public_ip
----

2. SSH into the instance:

[source,bash]
----
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@<public-ip>
----

3. Once logged in, check if the file is present at `/tmp/`:

[source,bash]
----
cat /tmp/config_file.conf
----

You should see the contents of `config_file.conf`, such as:

[source]
----
app_config = { max_connections = 100 }
----

=== 7. Cleanup Resources
Once you have verified that the file was successfully uploaded, you can clean up the resources by running:

[source,bash]
----
terraform destroy
----

Confirm with `yes` to destroy the EC2 instance and other resources.

== Summary of the Lab
In this lab, you learned how to use the **File Provisioner** in Terraform to upload files to a remote resource. Here's a summary of what you accomplished:
- **Provisioned an EC2 instance** using Terraform.
- **Used the File Provisioner** to upload a local file (`config_file.conf`) to the EC2 instance.
- **Verified the file transfer** by SSHing into the instance and checking the `/tmp/` directory.
- **Cleaned up** the resources once the verification was successful.

== Key Takeaways:
- The **file provisioner** is useful for transferring configuration files, scripts, or other artifacts from your local machine to remote resources.
- It is important to configure **SSH access** for the instance to use the file provisioner with remote resources like EC2.
- Always clean up your resources with `terraform destroy` to avoid unnecessary costs.
