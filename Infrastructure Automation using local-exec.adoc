== Objective
In this lab, you will automate the creation of AWS infrastructure using Terraform. You will also use the **`local-exec` provisioner** in Terraform to trigger post-provisioning tasks by invoking AWS CLI commands. Specifically, you will create an EC2 instance and use `local-exec` to interact with AWS services, such as creating an S3 bucket and uploading a file, using the AWS CLI.

By the end of this lab, you will understand how to automate both infrastructure provisioning and post-provisioning operations using Terraform and the AWS CLI.

== Scenario
You need to provision an **EC2 instance** in AWS using Terraform and then automate the process of creating an **S3 bucket** and uploading a file to it using the **AWS CLI**. The **`local-exec` provisioner** will be used to execute AWS CLI commands on your local machine, after the EC2 instance is created, to automate the creation of the S3 bucket and file upload.

== Lab Steps

=== 1. Set Up AWS Credentials
Ensure that you have configured AWS credentials (either using environment variables or AWS credentials file) to allow Terraform and the AWS CLI to create and manage resources.

Example:
[source,bash]
----
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
----

Ensure that the **AWS CLI** is installed and configured with the same credentials.

[source,bash]
----
aws configure
----

=== 2. Create Terraform Configuration
1. **Create a new directory** for your Terraform configuration files.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir terraform-local-exec
cd terraform-local-exec
----

2. **Create a `main.tf` file** to define your AWS EC2 instance and the `local-exec` provisioner to trigger AWS CLI commands.

[source,hcl]
----
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Ubuntu 20.04 LTS AMI ID for your region
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  # Security Group to allow SSH
  security_groups = ["allow_ssh"]

  # User data to install AWS CLI
  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              apt-get update
              apt-get install -y awscli
              EOF

  # Define Local-exec Provisioner
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "aws s3 mb s3://my-terraform-bucket && aws s3 cp ./sample_file.txt s3://my-terraform-bucket/"
  }

  # Connection details for SSH
  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ssh" {
  name        = "allow_ssh"
  description = "Allow SSH access"
  
  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
----

In this configuration:
- An EC2 instance (`aws_instance`) is provisioned with Ubuntu and the AWS CLI installed via user data.
- A **`local-exec` provisioner** is used to create an S3 bucket (`my-terraform-bucket`) and upload a file (`sample_file.txt`) to it using the AWS CLI.
- A **Security Group** is created to allow SSH access to the EC2 instance.
- SSH connection details are provided in the `connection` block for SSH access to the EC2 instance.

3. **Create the `sample_file.txt` file** that will be uploaded to the S3 bucket:

[source,bash]
----
echo "This is a test file for S3 upload." > sample_file.txt
----

=== 3. Initialize Terraform
Run `terraform init` to initialize your working directory. This command downloads the necessary provider plugins.

[source,bash]
----
terraform init
----

=== 4. Plan the Infrastructure Changes
Run `terraform plan` to see the changes Terraform will make. This command will show you a preview of the EC2 instance creation and the `local-exec` command execution.

[source,bash]
----
terraform plan
----

Verify that Terraform plans to:
- Create an AWS EC2 instance.
- Create a security group allowing SSH.
- Use the `local-exec` provisioner to create an S3 bucket and upload the file.

=== 5. Apply the Terraform Configuration
Run `terraform apply` to apply the configuration and create the resources.

[source,bash]
----
terraform apply
----

Terraform will:
1. Create the EC2 instance.
2. Create the security group.
3. Execute the `local-exec` provisioner, which will:
   - Create the S3 bucket (`my-terraform-bucket`).
   - Upload `sample_file.txt` to the S3 bucket.

Confirm the apply by typing `yes` when prompted.

=== 6. Verify S3 Bucket and File Upload
Once the Terraform apply is complete, verify that the S3 bucket and file were successfully created and uploaded.

1. Check the S3 bucket from the AWS Management Console or use the AWS CLI:

[source,bash]
----
aws s3 ls s3://my-terraform-bucket/
----

You should see the `sample_file.txt` listed as the object inside the bucket.

2. Optionally, download the file to confirm it was uploaded successfully:

[source,bash]
----
aws s3 cp s3://my-terraform-bucket/sample_file.txt ./downloaded_sample_file.txt
cat downloaded_sample_file.txt
----

The contents should match the original file:

[source]
----
This is a test file for S3 upload.
----

=== 7. Cleanup Resources
Once you have verified that the S3 bucket and file upload were successful, you can clean up the resources by running:

[source,bash]
----
terraform destroy
----

Confirm with `yes` to destroy the EC2 instance, security group, and S3 bucket.

== Summary of the Lab
In this lab, you learned how to use the **`local-exec` provisioner** in Terraform to automate post-provisioning tasks using the AWS CLI. Here's a summary of what you accomplished:
- **Provisioned an EC2 instance** using Terraform and installed AWS CLI via user data.
- **Used the `local-exec` provisioner** to trigger AWS CLI commands that create an S3 bucket and upload a file to it.
- **Verified the S3 bucket** creation and file upload using AWS CLI.
- **Cleaned up** the resources once the verification was successful.

== Key Takeaways:
- The **`local-exec` provisioner** allows you to run local commands or scripts on the machine where Terraform is running, useful for post-provisioning automation.
- You can use the **AWS CLI** within the `local-exec` provisioner to interact with AWS resources, such as S3, EC2, or Lambda.
- Always clean up your resources with `terraform destroy` to avoid unnecessary costs.
