= Terraform Cost Estimation with Infracost
John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
v1.0, 2024-12-31

This lab demonstrates how to integrate **Infracost** into your Terraform workflow to predict and manage cloud costs. Infracost is an open-source tool that reads your Terraform manifests and provides an estimate of the monthly or annual cost of your infrastructure, helping you optimize resources and plan budgets effectively.

== In This Lab, You Will

- **Install Infracost** on your local machine (example: Windows).
- **Create a simple Terraform configuration** with AWS resources.
- **Set up Infracost** to analyze your Terraform plan.
- **Interpret cost breakdown** outputs and make cost-aware decisions.
- **(Optional) Integrate Infracost** into CI (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated cost checks.

== Prerequisites

1. **Terraform Installed**  
   - Ensure you have Terraform v1.x or above on your system.  
   - If you need help, refer to https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads

2. **AWS Credentials**  
   - Store AWS credentials (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) so Terraform can authenticate with AWS.  
   - Or skip the actual apply if you only want to see cost estimation.

3. **Python (Optional)**  
   - Some Infracost installation methods rely on Python/pip. Alternatively, you can install Infracost via a standalone installer or Homebrew on Windows (if you have Windows Subsystem for Linux or a supported environment).

4. **Windows Operating System**  
   - This lab shows instructions for Windows; adapt accordingly for other OS.

== Section 1: Lab Setup and Directory Structure

Create a folder for this project, for example:
----
C:\Projects\infracost-lab\
----
Inside this folder, we will create:

----
infracost-lab/
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
└── infracost-usage.yml   (Optional advanced usage)
----

Feel free to add a `.gitignore` or README as needed.

----

== Section 2: Installing and Configuring Infracost

=== 2.1 Installation on Windows

There are multiple ways to install Infracost. Below are two common methods:

**Method A: Standalone Installer (Recommended)**
. Download the latest Windows .exe from the Infracost releases page:  
  https://github.com/infracost/infracost/releases
. Place the `.exe` in a folder like `C:\Infracost\`.
. Add that folder to your **Path** environment variable.  
. Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell and verify:
----
infracost --version
----

**Method B: Using pip**  
If you have Python installed and prefer pip:
----
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install infracost
----
Then verify:
----
infracost --version
----

=== 2.2 Configure Your API Key (Optional)

If you have an Infracost API key (for SaaS features like cost policies or cost diff notifications):
1. Run:
----
infracost auth login
----
2. Follow prompts to authenticate with your Infracost account.

*(If you don’t have an account, you can continue without this step for local cost estimates.)*

----

== Section 3: Creating a Simple Terraform Configuration

We’ll create an AWS S3 bucket and an AWS EC2 instance for demonstration.

=== 3.1 `main.tf`
[source,hcl]
----
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
  # Some minimal config
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami                    = "ami-0c02fb55956c7d316"  # Amazon Linux 2 in us-east-1
  instance_type          = "t2.micro"
  # Basic user data or tags could be added here
}
----

=== 3.2 `variables.tf`
[source,hcl]
----
variable "aws_region" {
  type        = string
  description = "AWS region to use for the resources"
  default     = "us-east-1"
}

variable "bucket_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "Name of the S3 bucket. Must be globally unique."
  default     = "my-infracost-lab-bucket-123"
}
----

*Note*:
- We use a default `instance_type` of `t2.micro` for demonstration, which is relatively low-cost.
- Update `bucket_name` to a globally unique string if you plan on actually creating it.

----

== Section 4: Infracost Setup and Usage

=== 4.1 Generating a Terraform Plan JSON

Infracost reads a JSON representation of your Terraform plan. We will generate it manually:

1. **Initialize** your Terraform project:
----
terraform init
----

2. **Generate a plan** in JSON format:
----
terraform plan -out plan.tfplan
terraform show -json plan.tfplan > plan.json
----
- `terraform plan -out plan.tfplan` creates a binary plan file.
- `terraform show -json plan.tfplan > plan.json` exports the plan to `plan.json`.

=== 4.2 Infracost Breakdown

Run Infracost on the generated `plan.json`:
----
infracost breakdown --path plan.json
----
You should see an output similar to:
----
Name                                              Monthly Qty  Unit     Monthly Cost
aws_instance.example
 ├─ Instance usage (Linux/UNIX, on-demand, t2.micro)  730     hours      $8.76
 ...
aws_s3_bucket.example
 └─ Storage (standard)
    ...
PROJECT TOTAL                                                          $10.00/mo
----

The exact costs may differ based on current AWS pricing.

=== 4.3 Interpreting the Results

- **PROJECT TOTAL**: Summarizes the estimated monthly cost for your Terraform resources.
- You’ll see individual line items for each AWS resource.  
- For the EC2 instance, costs reflect:
  - Instance hours (assuming 24/7 usage = 730 hours monthly).
  - Possibly EBS volume costs if an EBS volume is attached by default.
- For the S3 bucket, costs can vary if you store data or enable advanced features (like versioning, replication).

=== 4.4 Optional: Infracost Usage File

You can further refine estimates by creating an `infracost-usage.yml` that indicates usage parameters (like amount of data stored in S3, data transfer, etc.). Example:

[source,yaml]
----
version: 0.1
usage:
  aws_s3_bucket.example:
    monthly_storage_gb: 50
  aws_instance.example:
    monthly_cpu_hours: 20
----

Then run:
----
infracost breakdown --path plan.json --usage-file infracost-usage.yml
----
to incorporate your usage estimates (50GB in S3, 20 CPU hours on the EC2, etc.).

----

== Section 5: (Optional) Integrating Into CI/CD

Below is a minimal GitHub Actions snippet (`.github/workflows/infracost.yaml`) that automates cost estimation:

[source,yaml]
----
name: "Infracost CI"

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  infracost:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.5.4

      - name: Generate plan
        run: |
          terraform init
          terraform plan -out plan.tfplan
          terraform show -json plan.tfplan > plan.json

      - name: Set up Infracost
        uses: infracost/actions@v2
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.INFRACOST_API_KEY }}
          command: breakdown
          path: plan.json
          usage_file: infracost-usage.yml
          # Additional flags if needed
----

*Key Points*:
- This workflow scans your Terraform plan on each pull request to `main`.
- `infracost/actions@v2` automates the usage of Infracost in CI pipelines.
- You can store `INFRACOST_API_KEY` as a GitHub secret.

----

== Section 6: Cleanup

If you actually applied the resources, remove them to avoid unnecessary charges:

----
terraform destroy -auto-approve
----

Check your AWS console to confirm the EC2 instance and S3 bucket are deleted.

----

== Recap and Best Practices

- **Estimate Costs Early**: Integrate cost checks in your local workflow (`infracost breakdown`) before production deployment.
- **Usage Parameters**: Provide realistic usage data (e.g., monthly storage, data transfer) for more accurate estimates.
- **Automate in CI**: Add Infracost to pull requests so teams can see cost implications before merging.
- **Right-Sizing**: Use cost estimates to select smaller/larger resources or cheaper regions when feasible.
- **Update Pricing**: Cloud providers update pricing regularly; keep an eye on Infracost version and your usage assumptions for accurate results.

----

== Conclusion

In this lab, you:
- Installed Infracost on Windows and generated a Terraform plan JSON.
- Analyzed AWS infrastructure costs (an S3 bucket and an EC2 instance).
- Explored usage-based refinements with an `infracost-usage.yml` file.
- Learned how to integrate cost estimation into a CI pipeline for continuous cost monitoring.

This workflow helps you spot potentially high-cost resources early, keep infrastructure costs under control, and plan budgets more effectively for your cloud environments.
