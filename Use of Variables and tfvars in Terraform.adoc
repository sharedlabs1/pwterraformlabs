= Lab Objective: Demonstrating the Use of Variables and tfvars in Terraform

== Lab Overview

In this lab, we will demonstrate how using Terraform variables and `tfvars` files can make your infrastructure configurations more **dynamic** and **reusable**. By using variables, we can avoid hardcoding values and make it easier to configure and maintain Terraform configurations across different environments.

**Key Concepts:**
- **variables.tf**: Defines variables that will be used across your Terraform configuration.
- **tfvars file**: A file that contains the actual values for the variables, allowing you to reuse the same Terraform configuration with different input values.

== Scenario

### Use Case

You are responsible for provisioning **EC2 instances** on AWS using Terraform. However, your organization wants to deploy the same infrastructure in different environments (e.g., **Development**, **Production**) with different settings, such as:
- EC2 instance types
- AMI IDs
- Tags for identification

Instead of modifying the Terraform configuration each time, we can use **variables** to parameterize these values. Using a `variables.tf` file to define the variables and a `terraform.tfvars` file to specify values allows you to reuse the same Terraform configuration in multiple environments by simply changing the values in the `tfvars` file.

### Lab Objective

In this lab, you will:
1. Create a `variables.tf` file to define variables.
2. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file to provide the values for these variables.
3. Use these variables in the main Terraform configuration to provision an EC2 instance with different configurations based on the environment.

== Steps to Implement

### Step 1: Create `variables.tf` to Define Variables

In the `variables.tf` file, we define all the variables that will be used in our Terraform configuration.

[source,hcl]
----
# variables.tf

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The type of EC2 instance to create"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"  # Default value (can be overridden in tfvars)
}

variable "ami_id" {
  description = "AMI ID to use for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
}

variable "environment" {
  description = "The environment (e.g., Development, Production)"
  type        = string
}

variable "instance_name" {
  description = "Name for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
}
----

### Step 2: Create `terraform.tfvars` to Provide Values for Variables

In the `terraform.tfvars` file, we provide specific values for the variables defined in `variables.tf`.

[source,hcl]
----
# terraform.tfvars

instance_type = "t2.small"
ami_id        = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"  # Example AMI ID
environment   = "Development"
instance_name = "dev-server"
----

### Step 3: Main Terraform Configuration to Use Variables

In the main Terraform configuration (e.g., `main.tf`), we reference the variables defined in `variables.tf` and supplied in `terraform.tfvars`.

[source,hcl]
----
# main.tf

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  tags = {
    Name        = var.instance_name
    Environment = var.environment
  }
}
----

### Step 4: Apply the Configuration

To apply the Terraform configuration:

1. **Initialize Terraform**:  
   Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory and download the necessary providers.

2. **Plan the Deployment**:  
   Run `terraform plan` to see the changes that will be made.

3. **Apply the Configuration**:  
   Run `terraform apply` to provision the resources.

### Step 5: Modifying `terraform.tfvars` for Different Environments

You can modify the `terraform.tfvars` file to deploy the same infrastructure in different environments (e.g., Development, Production) by changing the values of the variables.

For example, for the **Production** environment, you could create a new `terraform.production.tfvars` file:

[source,hcl]
----
# terraform.production.tfvars

instance_type = "t3.medium"
ami_id        = "ami-0987654321abcdef0"  # Different AMI ID for production
environment   = "Production"
instance_name = "prod-server"
----

To apply the configuration with the Production values, run:
