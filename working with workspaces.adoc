= Terraform Workspaces and Environment-Specific Configuration Lab
John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
v1.0, 2024-12-31

An interactive lab demonstrating how to:
- Configure development, staging, and production workspaces in Terraform
- Manage environment-specific variables
- Maintain consistent resource naming across different workspaces

== Lab Overview

In this lab, you will:

1. Create a new Terraform project that uses multiple workspaces (dev, staging, prod).
2. Manage environment-specific variable files to store different values for each workspace.
3. Implement a naming convention to differentiate resources across workspaces.
4. Apply the configurations in each workspace and observe how Terraform manages separate state files.

== Prerequisites

1. **Terraform Installed**: Ensure you have Terraform v1.x or above installed.
2. **AWS Credentials**: Configure AWS CLI with valid credentials (e.g., `aws configure`) for demonstration.  
   _(Alternatively, you can adapt this lab to other cloud providers.)_
3. **Terminal or Shell Access**: A command-line environment is required to run Terraform commands.

----

== Section 1: Directory Structure and Use Case

=== 1.1 Project Layout

We will create a directory structure as follows:

----
terraform-workspaces-lab/
 ├── main.tf
 ├── variables.tf
 ├── outputs.tf
 ├── dev.tfvars
 ├── staging.tfvars
 └── prod.tfvars
----

- **`main.tf`**: Contains the primary Terraform configuration and references variables.
- **`variables.tf`**: Declares input variables with default values (if any).
- **`outputs.tf`**: Defines any outputs from this configuration.
- **`dev.tfvars`, `staging.tfvars`, `prod.tfvars`**: Each file holds environment-specific variable values.

=== 1.2 Use Case Description

Assume your company manages an S3 bucket for storing logs or assets. You need three different environments:
- **dev**: for developers to test changes
- **staging**: for testing in a near-production-like environment
- **production**: for actual usage by end users

Each environment will have:
- A unique bucket name (e.g., `mycompany-dev-logs`, `mycompany-staging-logs`, `mycompany-prod-logs`)
- Potentially different configurations (like tags or ACLs).

Terraform workspaces will isolate state for each environment, ensuring that the dev environment does not overwrite the production state.

----

== Section 2: Create Configuration Files

=== 2.1 `main.tf`
[source,hcl]
----
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# This resource will change its name based on the current workspace or variable inputs
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "logs" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
  
  # Example tag to help identify the environment
  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Name        = "${var.environment}-logs-bucket"
  }
}
----

=== 2.2 `variables.tf`
[source,hcl]
----
variable "environment" {
  type        = string
  description = "Environment name (dev, staging, prod)"
  default     = "dev"
}

variable "bucket_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "Name of the S3 bucket to create"
}
----

=== 2.3 `outputs.tf`
[source,hcl]
----
output "bucket_name" {
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket"
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.logs.bucket
}

output "environment" {
  description = "Current environment"
  value       = var.environment
}
----

----

== Section 3: Environment-Specific Variable Files

You will create three `.tfvars` files, each containing environment-specific values.

=== 3.1 `dev.tfvars`
[source,hcl]
----
environment  = "dev"
bucket_name  = "mycompany-dev-logs"
----

=== 3.2 `staging.tfvars`
[source,hcl]
----
environment  = "staging"
bucket_name  = "mycompany-staging-logs"
----

=== 3.3 `prod.tfvars`
[source,hcl]
----
environment  = "prod"
bucket_name  = "mycompany-prod-logs"
----

These files store the different values that we will pass in when creating each environment.

----

== Section 4: Initializing and Using Workspaces

Terraform workspaces allow you to maintain multiple state files in a single configuration directory. By default, Terraform starts in the **default** workspace, but we will create additional workspaces for dev, staging, and prod.

=== 4.1 Initialize Terraform

Navigate to your project directory and initialize Terraform.

----
terraform init
----

=== 4.2 Create and Select Workspaces

.Create three workspaces (dev, staging, prod)

----
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new prod
----

You can confirm the current workspace:

----
terraform workspace list
----

.Select a workspace

----
terraform workspace select dev
----

Terraform is now operating in the **dev** workspace, meaning it will store its state in a file named `terraform.tfstate.d/dev/terraform.tfstate`.

----

== Section 5: Applying Configurations in Each Workspace

Each environment should be applied separately to manage its own infrastructure.

=== 5.1 Apply for Development

1. **Select** the dev workspace (if not already):
----
terraform workspace select dev
----

2. **Apply** using `dev.tfvars`:
----
terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars" -auto-approve
----

Terraform will create the dev S3 bucket named `mycompany-dev-logs`.

=== 5.2 Apply for Staging

1. **Select** the staging workspace:
----
terraform workspace select staging
----

2. **Apply** with staging variables:
----
terraform apply -var-file="staging.tfvars" -auto-approve
----

Terraform creates the `mycompany-staging-logs` bucket. The state is stored separately from dev.

=== 5.3 Apply for Production

1. **Select** the production workspace:
----
terraform workspace select prod
----

2. **Apply** with prod variables:
----
terraform apply -var-file="prod.tfvars" -auto-approve
----

Terraform creates the `mycompany-prod-logs` bucket with no overlap or conflict with dev or staging.

----

== Section 6: Resource Naming Across Workspaces

Notice in our `main.tf`:
----
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "logs" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Name        = "${var.environment}-logs-bucket"
  }
}
----
- `bucket = var.bucket_name` ensures a unique bucket name for each workspace.
- The resource tag includes `Environment = var.environment`, so you can easily identify which environment a resource belongs to in the AWS console.
- **Important**: S3 bucket names must be globally unique across AWS, so `bucket_name` in each environment’s `.tfvars` helps avoid naming conflicts.

This pattern generalizes to other resources (e.g., EC2, RDS). Just use `var.environment` in the resource’s name or tag to ensure clarity and uniqueness.

----

== Section 7: Observing Separate States

=== 7.1 Viewing the State Files

Each workspace keeps its own state in `terraform.tfstate.d/<workspace>/terraform.tfstate`.

For example:
- `terraform.tfstate.d/dev/terraform.tfstate`
- `terraform.tfstate.d/staging/terraform.tfstate`
- `terraform.tfstate.d/prod/terraform.tfstate`

You can run commands like:
----
terraform state list
----
to see what resources are tracked in the current workspace’s state.

=== 7.2 Confirming Resource Separation

Switching workspaces shows different infrastructure in each state:
----
terraform workspace select dev
terraform state list
----
You’ll see resources for the **dev** environment.

Switch again:
----
terraform workspace select staging
terraform state list
----
Now the resources for the **staging** environment.

----

== Section 8: Cleaning Up

If you want to remove infrastructure from each environment, ensure you select the proper workspace before running `destroy`:

1. **Destroy dev**:
----
terraform workspace select dev
terraform destroy -var-file="dev.tfvars" -auto-approve
----

2. **Destroy staging**:
----
terraform workspace select staging
terraform destroy -var-file="staging.tfvars" -auto-approve
----

3. **Destroy prod**:
----
terraform workspace select prod
terraform destroy -var-file="prod.tfvars" -auto-approve
----

Each environment’s resources are independently managed and destroyed.

----

== Section 9: Best Practices and Summary

1. **Use Workspaces for Multiple Environments**  
   - Keep separate states for dev, staging, and production.  
   - Avoid mixing multiple environments in a single state file.

2. **Leverage .tfvars**  
   - Provide environment-specific values.  
   - Helps enforce unique naming and configurations across dev, staging, and prod.

3. **Consistent Naming Conventions**  
   - Use the environment name or prefix in your resource names (e.g., `<env>-logs-bucket`).  
   - Prevents collisions and makes it clear which environment a resource belongs to.

4. **Validate with `terraform plan`**  
   - Always review changes in each workspace before applying or destroying resources.

5. **Security Considerations**  
   - Keep sensitive credentials or secrets out of version control.  
   - If your variables are sensitive, store them securely (e.g., using a secure secrets manager).

By following this approach, you ensure that changes in one environment do not accidentally impact another. Terraform workspaces combined with environment-specific variable files make your infrastructure more modular, maintainable, and secure.

----

== Conclusion

In this lab, you learned how to:
- Configure **development**, **staging**, and **production** workspaces using Terraform.
- Store environment-specific variables in `.tfvars` files and apply them to each workspace.
- Maintain separate state files and naming conventions to prevent conflicts across environments.
- Validate and destroy resources in each environment independently.

You now have a foundation for scaling this pattern to more complex infrastructure, ensuring safe and organized deployments across multiple stages of the software development lifecycle.
